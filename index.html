		<p class="Intro">
			Prepare yourself for a royal treat. The Sovereign is a welcoming and
			lively neighbourhood cafe dedicated to the absolute rule of
			exceptional coffee. It's place where regulars are greeted by name,
			locals meet to hear the news and connoisseurs flock to sample the
			best shots pulled this side of the Bridge of Sighs.
		</p>
		<p class="Intro">
			The Sovereign was founded by childhood friends Rosario Salvi and
			Gianfranco Voce. Born and raised in Davenport Village, they set out
			to create a coffee destination and a community hub. Since opening
			their doors in 2012, they've been joined by head chef Anthony Menna
			and now offer brunch, house-made snacks, and baked goods.
		</p>
		<p class="Intro">
			With their love of hosting and devotion to grinding only the most
			delectable beans, Salvi, Voce and Menna invite you to drop by and
			find out why The Sovereign rules.

		<p class="Intro">
			Born and raised in the neighbourhood of Davenport Village, childhood friends Rosario Salvi and Gianfranco Voce sought out to create a hub for their community. In May 2012, they opened The Sovereign; a café committed to serving excellent coffee in a welcoming and lively environment. Since then The Sovereign has evolved into a pillar for the community acting as both a meeting place for local residents and business owners and a destination spot for espresso aficionados. Salvi and Voce’s Italian heritage, reflected in their love of hosting and a dedication to quality ingredients, has naturally encouraged a desire to bring food into the picture. In 2013, head chef Anthony Menna joined the team; the café now offers brunch, house-made snacks, and baked goods. Salvi, Voce and Menna are passionate about their community and The Sovereign remains committed to serving the needs of an evolving, diverse, and exciting neighbourhood.

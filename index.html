		<p class="Intro">
			Born and raised in the neighbourhood of Davenport Village, childhood
			friends Rosario Salvi and Gianfranco Voce sought out to create a hub
			for their community. In May 2012, they opened The Sovereign; a caf&eacute;
			committed to serving excellent coffee in a welcoming and lively
			environment. Since then The Sovereign has evolved into a pillar for
			the community acting as both a meeting place for local residents and
			business owners and a destination spot for espresso aficionados.
			Salvi and Voce's Italian heritage, reflected in their love of hosting
			and a dedication to quality ingredients, has naturally encouraged a
			desire to bring food into the picture. In 2013, head chef Anthony Menna
			joined the team; the caf&eacute; now offers brunch, house-made snacks, and
			baked goods. Salvi, Voce and Menna are passionate about their community
			and The Sovereign remains committed to serving the needs of an
			evolving, diverse, and exciting neighbourhood.
